## A little bit about yourself:

From early childhood I wanted to become a programmer, I still can't explain my craving for this profession, but here I am. After graduating from high school, I tried to go to college as a general programmer, but the group was closed and I had to get the profession of a civil engineer. Many years later I decided to do programming again and my choice fell on front-end development and in particular on JS. By all means, I will go through this path to the end. Thank you for your attention!

## Code example:

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

```
function getCount(str) {
  var vowelsCount = 0;
  var vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"];
  for(var i = 0;i < str.length;i++){
    for(var j=0;j<vowels.length;j++){
      if(str[i] === vowels[j]){
        vowelsCount++;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return vowelsCount;
}
```
